# Project Overview

## Implemented Built-in Commands

Here's a list of the built-in commands that have been implemented so far:

- [x] exit
- [x] echo
- [x] type
- [x] pwd
- [x] cd
- [x] history

## Upcoming Built-in Commands

The following commands are planned to be implemented in the future:

- [ ] alias
- [ ] export
- [ ] set
- [ ] unset
- [ ] source (or .)
- [ ] jobs
- [ ] fg
- [ ] bg
- [ ] help
